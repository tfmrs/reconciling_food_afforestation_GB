This is the repository for the paper "Recirculating aquaculture can reconcile food supply and afforestation in Great Britain" 


To run a simulation of the partial equilibrium model:
(1) Download this whole "simulations" folder (with the R_codes subfolder) to your machine;
(2) Open, from the R_codes folder, the R script "R_caller_generic_(add_your_folder)_default";
(3) Replace the full path to the "simulations" folder as indicated in the R script;
(4) By default, the zero RAS grant subsidy scenario is run. If other scenario is desired, change as indicated in the R script;
(5) Run the last line, as indicated. It takes about 4 hours, probably 5 hours, in a i7 computer to finish.
